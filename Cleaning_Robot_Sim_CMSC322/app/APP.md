# Applications

The robot fleet management system will be a high level application.
It will need to communicate with a simulator and a back end storage system.
Any other apps you require may be included in here.

By convention, these applications use the libaries you create.
So maybe you have a library of robots, then the application should include the header for it like `say_hello` does with `libhello`.
