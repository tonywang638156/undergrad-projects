# CMSC322 Main Project

This main project is your repository for the duration of the semester! **Take care of it!**
Your team must communicate and coordinate to ensure that this project repo does not get totally borked!

## Repo Structure
Here are the main directories you need to worry about this semester:
+ `docs` - this [folder](docs/README.md) maintains **all** of your project documentation: `puml` files and `README`s. You will have deliverables that require updating this documentation.
+ `include` - the [include](include/INCLUDE.md) files for the libraries your team makes
+ `src` - the [source](src/SRC.md) files for libraries you decide to split out the implementation
+ `app` - the [main application(s)](app/APP.md) of the project
+ `tests` - a battery of [tests](tests/TESTS.md) tests for your libraries and app

## Code Management

Your development must take place on your `integration` branch and *any* feature branches you make!
Given the work below, you must decompose it into smaller feature chunks and generate issues for each one. 
These issues will become a branch from `integration` using the same naming scheme as you did in the Team Contract practicum.
When your team is ready to submit new code to me for review, you will submit a PR from `integration` to `main` and **add me as a reviewer**.
**If this process is not followed, you will not earn all of your points for Github Management!**
