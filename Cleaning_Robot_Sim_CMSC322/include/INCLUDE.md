# Libraries
For this project, the library convention will be that each supporting library will live within its own subfolder.
Right now, there is one `libhello` library.
If you need to make a support library for the simulator, it might be `libsim`.

Header only libraries are fine.
To see the advantages and disadvantages, take a look at [this SO discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12671383/benefits-of-header-only-libraries).
