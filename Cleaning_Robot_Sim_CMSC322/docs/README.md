# Welcome to Our Application!

This file is the root of your documentation tree.
You will write all of these in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) and GitHub will render them.

## Designs and Documentation

Each new piece of your system, such as a library or an app, needs a new directory.
Example: you make a storage backend library, `libstorage` - then its docs folder will be title `libstorage` and hold one or more README files and PlantUML models.
To manage the links among the files, see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files) on README links.
