## Enhancing Visual Performance on Dancing Robots with OAK-D PRO
+ Conducted research on OAK-D PRO depth camera to enhance the vision performance on dancing robot • Contructed pipeline using DepthAI’s API in OAK-D PRO camera
+ Used openCV to analyze frames detected in the OAK camera and achieve feature tracking and stereo depth estimation
+ Utilized Flood IR LED illumination to enable perception in low-light and no-light environments, and implemented Laser dot projector to enhance passive depth perception for low-visual-interest surfaces.
+ Utilized openVINO to embed custom model and YOLO model into OAK camera by converting from pytorch form into blob form
+ Implemented non-maximum suppression and skeleton plotting
+ Embedding YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 model into OAK camera to achieve lower latency object detection and human pose estimation
