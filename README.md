## Enhancing Visual Performance on Dancing Robots with OAK-D PRO
+ Conducted research on OAK-D PRO depth camera to enhance the vision performance on dancing robot 
+ Contructed pipeline using DepthAIâ€™s API in OAK-D PRO camera
+ Used openCV to analyze frames detected in the OAK camera and achieve feature tracking and stereo depth estimation
+ Utilized Flood IR LED illumination to enable perception in low-light and no-light environments, and implemented Laser dot projector to enhance passive depth perception for low-visual-interest surfaces.
+ Utilized openVINO to embed custom model and YOLO model into OAK camera by converting from pytorch form into blob form
+ Implemented non-maximum suppression and skeleton plotting
+ Embedding YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 model into OAK camera to achieve lower latency object detection and human pose estimation

## Exploration of Urban Blight and Property Values via Deep Learning
+ Conducted research on the influence of house appearance on housing prices using Google Street View photos and pixel-based scoring.
+ Employed advanced techniques, including Transfer Learning with VGG16 and AlexNet, for predictive classification of satellite images.
+ Utilized R studio's Spatial Data capabilities to establish spatial links between residents and their respective neighborhoods.
+ Applied hedonic model incorporating property attributes along with seasonality fixed effects to accurately estimate property value.
